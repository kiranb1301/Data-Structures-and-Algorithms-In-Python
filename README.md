# Linked-List-Operations  https://github.com/kiranb1301/Linked-List-Operations/tree/main  
 Create Node structure of Linked List.(Line 4 to 7)  <br>
Crete actual Linked list class with initialization of head Node as None. and write the code for operations which will be performe on linked List.  <br>
 1. Insertion Operation-1.At Begin (Head Node), 2.At end(before the node of None) 3. At any position (after the value using index position or Value present in linked list) <br>
 2. Deletion Operation- 1.From Begin(Head Node), 2. From End (Before the None) 3.From Any position (Using index as well as Value)  <br>
3. Search Opeation  - 1. By using Value (i.e find index of given value)   2. By using index (i.e.find the value at given index) <br>
 4. Display The operations performed on linked list (i.e. Traversal of Linked list)  <br>
5. File 2 demonstrates that stack operations performed using singly linked list.  <br>
6. File 3 demonstrates that stack operations performed using simple list in python.
